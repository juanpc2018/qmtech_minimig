# Open Adaptive Amiga Retro System (Open AARS)

This PCB has been designed for my project in order to run the Minimig Amiga core on a board of my own design.
The core FPGA board I bought of Aliexpress, because soldering the very fine pitched BGA socket is too cumbersome.

More detailed documents regarding the I/O board can be found in the docs directory in this repository.

The board as is works, the features have been tested individually, but I'm still working on the Minimig port at this time.
Since I work on this in my spare time progress is not super fast, but progress is made.
For now I'm mostly learning and developing at the same time so a lot of stuff changes.
When the code base becomes more stable and usable I'll open the repository up.

## Interfaces provided by this I/O board

- Atari/Amiga compatible Joystick ports
- PS/2 keyboard interface for mouse and keyboard
- Analog head phone jack via
- External floppy interface to connect Amiga floppy drives (Including 12V power pin)
- HDMI display connector that supports up to full HD video (1920x1080)
- 6 status LEDS
- Internal Amiga floppy drive connector
- External Amiga floppy drive connector (DIN-23)
- AS4C16M16SA-6TCN 32Mb SDRAM
- ESP32 micro controller
  - SD-card interface
  - Wifi connectivity
  - RS-232 over USB to program and communicate with the Python shell
  - Python shell via [Batch firmware](https://github.com/badgeteam/ESP32-platform-firmware)
  - SPI communication with the FPGA
  - I2C communication with the FPGA and ADV7511 (HDMI transmitter)

## Platforms that _could_ run with this IO board

- C64
- Amiga 1200/500(+)
- Atari ST
- Other 80's and 90's machines?

Keep in mind I'm only planning on making an Amiga core for this board, but feel free to contribute other cores.
